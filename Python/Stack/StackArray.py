# Stack is a LIFO data structures:
# LIFO stands for Last In First Out 

# We can't access any element except top. Top is that element which has been inserted at last
# and can be retrieved first.

# I am assuming that you are here after going through the theory of Stack and looking for implementation.

# Output:
# The element is pushed and top points to => 10
# The element is pushed and top points to => 20
# The element is pushed and top points to => 30
# Deleted element is: 30
# Top element is: 20
