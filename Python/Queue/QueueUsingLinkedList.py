# Queue is a FIFO/LILO data structures:
# FIFO stands for First In First Out 

# We can't access any element except front. Front is that element which has been inserted at first
# and will be retrieved first. Rear is that element which is inserted at last and will be deleted 
# at last.

# I am assuming that you are here after going through the theory of Queue and looking for implementation.

# Output: 	
# Enqueue Operation Done, rear is at 11
# Enqueue Operation Done, rear is at 12
# Enqueue Operation Done, rear is at 13
# Deleted Element is: 11
# Front element is: 12

# Run using: python filename.py

# A simple Node Structure
